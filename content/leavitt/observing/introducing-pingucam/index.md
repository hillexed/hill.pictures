Introducing... Pingu Camera. I bought a used DSLR for astrophotography four months ago hoping it would take better photos than my phone. I 3D printed an adapter for it to fit into a standard eyepiece slot. Unfortunately it was a bit of a failure for two reasons: firstly, this camera isn't mirrorless, so it had a shutter inside it, and when that shutter flips up to take photos it sends vibrations through the entire telescope. I couldn't get any good photos of planets. Secondly, the sensor is so far back into the camera that I have to get out a screwdriver and slide the entire upper tube a few inches closer to the mirror to achieve proper focus.
