Today, I tried finding some galaxies. I couldn't see M101, couldn't see M105, but did see M81 and M82 by eye. It was tough, but I finally took a phone pic. I decided to give Pingu Camera a try...  and the phone plus printed adapter plus phone remote shutter plus waiting a while for vibrations to die down worked! I got a picture of both M81 and M82!!
