Previously, @Beasmeeply generously donated me an 8" mirror blank, kick-starting an attempt to finish grinding it and make an 8" telescope. There are four stages of mirror grinding, so to figure out which step I needed to start with, [I put the mirror into a Foucault mirror tester, and it gave a smooth-ish image, telling me BeasMeeply had gotten through the first two stages of mirror making, rough and fine grinding, and it was ready to polish.](https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/3105482-i-tested-my-donated)

The next step is polishing, and to do that, I need a pitch lap! A pitch lap is a disk the same size as a mirror with a layer of pitch poured onto it and used as a grinding surface.

Step 1: Make a disk. 

Nowadays the cheapest way to do it is with waterproof plaster called dental stone. A local astronomy club had some and was willing to mix up some so I could use it... but they only had a paper bowl to mix it up in, we used too little, and the result was a thin pancake that cracked easily. I needed more stone and a thicker tool.

I looked online for where to buy dental stone. Assuming you don't want to buy a 25 lb bulk box ( I only need 1lb), it's very hard to find anywhere but the slightly expensive firsthanddiscovery.com .

And then: by chance, I had a pre-scheduled dentist appointment. During the appointment, I asked nicely, and they sent me home with two ziplock bags full of dental stone!

A trip to Goodwill got me a big plastic jug for mixing lots of dental stone in, and which I was okay ruining with bits of hardened stone. (The flexible plastic walls ended up being convenient for cleanup later - bending them meant large bits of hardened-on plaster cracked off!)

I got help online with the water-to-powder ratio [30 ml water/100 g powder](
https://www.greatlakesdentaltech.com/50lbs-modern-materials-denstone-golden-215-007.html), grabbed one of my failed wooden carvings from the meniscus mirror project to contain any spills, and got mixing. Dental stone hardened so quickly - within two minutes it was noticably hard to mix. I thought I had messed up the water-to-powder ratio because it felt too dry, so I added more water and then it was suddenly very runny. When I dipped a plastic fork in it, it didn't drip off the fork, however.

Worried that if I waited any longer it would harden, I poured the plaster (using my mirror blank as the mold with a layer of plastic wrap on top). The dental stone was already so viscous it didn't smooth itself out to a level surface, giving me an uneven back.

Then I had to wait a week for it to dry before [I could turn the stone disk into a proper grinding tool!](https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/4286113-8-mirror-polishing)
