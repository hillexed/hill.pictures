A local astronomy club had some and was willing to mix up some so I could use it... but they only had a paper bowl to mix it up in, we used too little, and the result was a thin pancake that cracked easily. I needed more stone and a thicker tool."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"I looked online for where to buy dental stone. Assuming you don't want to buy a 25 lb bulk box ( I only need 1lb), it's very hard to find anywhere but the slightly expensive firsthanddiscovery.com ."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"And then: by chance, I had a pre-scheduled dentist appointment. During the appointment, I asked nicely, and they sent me home with two ziplock bags full of dental stone!"}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"A trip to Goodwill got me a big plastic jug for mixing lots of dental stone in, and which I was okay ruining with bits of hardened stone.

Dental stone hardened so quickly - within two minutes it was noticably hard to mix. I thought I had messed up the water-to-powder ratio because it felt too dry, so I added more water and then it was suddenly very runny. When I dipped a plastic fork in it, it didn't drip off the fork, however."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"Worried that if I waited any longer it would harden, I poured the plaster (using my mirror blank as the mold with a layer of plastic wrap on top).
