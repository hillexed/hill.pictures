Here's my mirror in a Ronchi test and a Foucault test. I've managed to reduce the turned down edge to a very small area but it's still there, visible in the ronchi as hooks at the edges and in the Foucault as a slight black zone at the bottom left of the image. I've also managed to dig a huge hole in the center of the mirror trying to fix that edge...
