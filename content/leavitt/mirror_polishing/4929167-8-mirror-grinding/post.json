There's a bit of TDE left to fight and the center is a bit messed up but I think I'm very close."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"From here I could either get everything to a sphere and grind out that TDE and then wear down the center again to make a parabola, or see if I can go to a parabola from where I am now. I don't quite know how to decide."}}],"pinned":false,"commentsLocked":false,"sharesLocked":false,"singlePostPageUrl":"https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/4929167-8-mirror-grinding"}
