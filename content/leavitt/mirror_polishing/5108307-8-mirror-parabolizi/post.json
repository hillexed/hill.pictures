Here's a Ronchi picture of my current progress. [Mel's online Ronchi calculator](https://www.bbastrodesigns.com/ronchi.html) has overlaid some semi-transparent white lines which show the ideal Ronchi grid of a somewhat parabolized mirror. Looks like the center is fine, but the edge is focusing light too close - similar to what happened in parabolizing attempt #1. I'll need to think to figure out how to solve this."}}],"pinned":false,"commentsLocked":false,"sharesLocked":false,"singlePostPageUrl":"https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/5108307-8-mirror-parabolizi"}
