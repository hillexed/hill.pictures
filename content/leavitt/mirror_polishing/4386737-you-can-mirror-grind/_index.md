you can mirror grind in two ways: mirror on top or tool on top. Apparently if you have a turned down edge to fix it you do center over center strokes with amplitude 1/3 of the length, according to a video by Gordon Waite. I did it for two hours yesterday and made little progress. Today I took another look at the video and noticed he was doing it tool on top. I wasn't.  30 minutes of work later it looks so much better. sighhh
