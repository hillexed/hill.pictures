You use a stroke that goes up and down fast and side to side slowly in a big zigzag, called a W stroke, to remove a tiny bit of glass from both the center and the edge, as seen in the first picture ([from Mel Bartels' site](https://www.bbastrodesigns.com/JoyOfMirrorMaking/Parabolizing.html#parabStrategies)). "}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"This stage involves removing very small amounts of glass, so parabolizing is very quick. After 15 minutes of a W stroke - which is crazy fast compared to hours and hours it took to get to spherical - my center was slightly deepened, enough to match a parabola! My mirror edge, however, still had very straight bands. The Ronchi test calculator said my edge wasn't where it should be."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"Then I made a mistake: the amateur astronomers in the discord said I had a turned edge, and I needed to return to spherical. A mirror edge that's too low can only be fixed by grinding the rest of the rest of the mirror down to that height. So I spent anouther two hours undoing all my hard parabolizing work. "}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"But in retrospect, I didn't need to do that at all - my edge was focusing light too close, so if I wore down the edge it would have focused light at a longer radius of curvature, which is what I wanted! I could have done that! I mistook the error for \"turned down edge\" when actually the edge wasn't turned down enough!"}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"Anyway, I'm back at a sphere. Parabolization attempt #2: begin!"}}],"pinned":false,"commentsLocked":false,"sharesLocked":false,"singlePostPageUrl":"https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/5104400-8-mirror-grinding"}
