It's been a while but I gave the 8" mirror some grinding. I'm on my way back to sphere, undoing parabolizing attempt #2. 30 minutes of grinding seems to have created some turned down edge and a hole in the middle. Great.

I put the mirror into the telescope, leaned it against a big crate again, and I was able to use it to see the moon! It's amazing that even though I'm not done figuring, it's smooth enough I can see things in space. It was noticeably dimmer and slightly less sharp than in my hadley, which makes sense because the 8" mirror isn't aluminized.

Now to keep at it, and then start parabolizing try #3.
