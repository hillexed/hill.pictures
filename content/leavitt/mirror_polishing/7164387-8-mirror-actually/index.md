Someone brought an extremely accurate "double pass autocollimator" tester to an amateur telescope maker meetup... and it showed an uniform shade of gray across the whole mirror, meaning no defects (ignore the circular reflections from the test stand). That means my mirror is an extremely smooth parabola! I'm done mirror grinding!

<span style="margin: 3em; padding: 1em; border-radius: 2em; background-color: darkblue; color: white;"> ðŸŽ‰ First mirror: complete! ðŸŽ‰ </span>

That's so cool! I thought I was slightly overparabolized based on my Foucalt testing. I guess not! That's so cool!

Start to finish: 8 months.
Total time spent working on this mirror, not counting setup or lap-pressing or testing time): 32.9 hours.
