I've switched to using the Foucalt test and a Couder mask for parabolizing. The Foucalt test is more precise (but more annoying) than the Ronchi test, but my local astronomy club has a foucalt testing rig with a micrometer that lets me measure very precise details of where different regions of the mirror focus light, so it's more accurately moveable than my handheld Ronchi tester. I built a cardboard "Couder mask" to block off regions of my mirror to see where the edge and center are focusing light to separately. I need to take so many measurements for this Foucalt test, which is time-consuming. I also built a spreadsheet to help me interpret the results. I'm so close to perfect parabola...
