Every telescope needs a mount, to hold it up and let it rotate. 6 months ago, I thought that I was close to the finish line, since all I had to do was make a mirror and a mount! Then the mirror took six months. Now I need to sit down and actually finish this mount.
My 4.5" scope uses a truss of EMT steel tubes and the scope sits on a wide C-shaped part. I modified that design for this 8" telescope's bigger bearings... only to realize before 3D printing that this 8" scope is 10" wide, too big for a support to fit onto my 3D printer. I sat down and modified the design so the telescope sits on two separate parts instead of sitting on one wide C-shaped part. I'll probably need to add an extra reinforcing bar on top to compensate for that extra bar I removed. Hope it works and I don't need more revisions.
