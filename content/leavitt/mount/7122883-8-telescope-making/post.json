Then the mirror took six months. Now I need to sit down and actually finish this mount.\nMy 4.5\" scope uses a truss of EMT steel tubes and the scope sits on a wide C-shaped part. I modified that design for this 8\" telescope's bigger bearings... only to realize before 3D printing that this 8\" scope is 10\" wide, too big for a support to fit onto my 3D printer. I sat down and modified the design so the telescope sits on two separate parts instead of sitting on one wide C-shaped part. I'll probably need to add an extra reinforcing bar on top to compensate for that extra bar I removed. Hope it works and I don't need more revisions."}}],"pinned":false,"commentsLocked":false,"sharesLocked":false,"singlePostPageUrl":"https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/7122883-8-telescope-making"}
