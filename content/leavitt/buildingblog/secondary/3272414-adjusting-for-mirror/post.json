However, several weeks ago, I printed a mirror holder that was designed to fit a mirror 2.46 inches wide. Sure, I could just use the bigger holder, but the bigger the secondary holder the more light it blocks from reaching your mirror. Is it worth a smaller secondary mirror holder that will block half a square inch less light? Yes, I decided. So I opened up the model and slightly scaled it down. It was a bit tricky because I didn't want to scale down the nut and screw holes, but I counted the sizes and scaled down the outside vertices in blender. I feel bad about wasting my previous print, but plastic is so cheap I'll only feel a little bad about it."}}],"pinned":false,"commentsLocked":false,"sharesLocked":false,"singlePostPageUrl":"https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/3272414-adjusting-for-mirror"}
