The outer zone is still a gradual slope but it focuses light to around a centimeter or so further than the inner zone. Previously that outer zone was extremely too tall, so my goal was to reduce it, and compared to a few weeks ago it looks reduced but not gone. There's also still 1/6\" of turned down edge, yaaaaay"}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"My pitch lap has developed regions around the edge where the pitch has fallen down and lost contact. I think the dental stone released a gas and created a bubble, which made the pitch above the bubble slowly fall down once the gas could escape."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"I tried a new technique: modifying my tool by putting a small cut portion of paper over the center while pressing, so the center of the tool doesn't make contact and wears down the center of the mirror less.
