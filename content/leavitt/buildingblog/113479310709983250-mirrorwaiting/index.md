Update: at long last, my now aluminized mirror is finally being shipped back to me!

A timeline of recent events: 

October 19: The mirror is aluminized. The aluminizer notes that he will wait a week to ensure the coating cures properly (reasonable and expected)<br />November 1: I am told that the mirror is "all set to send it out"<br />November 7: I ask for any shipping updates<br />November 10: I get a reply saying "I'll do it tomorrow"<br />November 11: radio silence<br />November 13: I ask for updates, and am told "I shipped it yesterday".

Sigh. A fitting end to the saga.

Edit: Update from the future! The saga didn't end.

November 15: Canada's postal union goes on strike.

November 30: My mirror continues to sit in an airport.

December 19: Canada's government orders the striking laborers back to work, which is very unfair since they deserve to be paid more, but my package is officially back on the move.
