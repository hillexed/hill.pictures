I did lots of research into what kind of secondary mirror to use. [This calculator](https://www.bbastrodesigns.com/NewtDesigner.html#diagonal) says a 62.5mm will give me the most even illumination across the field, but that's for super huge eyepieces so a slightly smaller one should be fine. I'd love to find a 60mm or 55mm one but I guess now I don't have to look nearly as hard"}}],"pinned":false,"commentsLocked":false,"sharesLocked":false,"singlePostPageUrl":"https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/3165590-i-was-cleaning-out-m"}
