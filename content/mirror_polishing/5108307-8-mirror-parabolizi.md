I'm [parabolizing my telescope mirror](https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/5104400-8-mirror-grinding) - I've [ground it to a sphere shape](https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/4995398-8-mirror-grinding), and now I'm grinding a tiny bit more to change its shape precisely into a parabola.

I've done 3 grinding sessions for a total of 34 minutes of grinding. Here's a Ronchi picture of my current progress. [Mel's online Ronchi calculator](https://www.bbastrodesigns.com/ronchi.html) has overlaid some semi-transparent white lines which show the ideal Ronchi grid of a somewhat parabolized mirror. Looks like the center is fine, but the edge is focusing light too close - similar to what happened in parabolizing attempt #1. I'll need to think to figure out how to solve this.
