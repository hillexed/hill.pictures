Check out this infographic of how to read the Ronchi tests of my telescope mirror! I've been posting lots of pictures like this as I grind, and this tells you how to interpret what the pictures say about a mirror's shape. The Ronchi test can be used to roughly measure a mirror's shape and see any turned down edge ("TDE"), and with a computer program to analyze them, even give some quantitative measurements.

(I drew the light hitting the mirrors on the left as parallel lines for clarity, but in the ronchi test the light is actually coming from a single point close to the focus. don't tell anyone)
