I'm in the home stretch - my goal is to turn this sphere shaped mirror into a parabola shaped mirror.

The final stage of mirror grinding is called either parabolizing, because you're making a parabola, or figuring, because you have to measure carefully and that involves numbers which are also called figures. You use a stroke that goes up and down fast and side to side slowly in a big zigzag, called a W stroke, to remove a tiny bit of glass from both the center and the edge, as seen in the first picture ([from Mel Bartels' site](https://www.bbastrodesigns.com/JoyOfMirrorMaking/Parabolizing.html#parabStrategies)). 

This stage involves removing very small amounts of glass, so parabolizing is very quick. After 15 minutes of a W stroke - which is crazy fast compared to hours and hours it took to get to spherical - my center was slightly deepened, enough to match a parabola! My mirror edge, however, still had very straight bands. The Ronchi test calculator said my edge wasn't where it should be.

Then I made a mistake: the amateur astronomers in the discord said I had a turned edge, and I needed to return to spherical. A mirror edge that's too low can only be fixed by grinding the rest of the rest of the mirror down to that height. So I spent anouther two hours undoing all my hard parabolizing work. 

But in retrospect, I didn't need to do that at all - my edge was focusing light too close, so if I wore down the edge it would have focused light at a longer radius of curvature, which is what I wanted! I could have done that! I mistook the error for "turned down edge" when actually the edge wasn't turned down enough!

Anyway, I'm back at a sphere. Parabolization attempt #2: begin!
