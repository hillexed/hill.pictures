The Legend of Zelbaba: A Linkeke Between Words is a one-of-a-kind custom levelpack for Baba Is You that is basically an entire Zelda game. Press the A button - which does nothing in Baba is You - and Keke will swing a sword! Or launch a bomb arrow! Or activate the magnesis rune! Released in 2019, it has ingame cutscenes, boss fights, and custom music, all implemented in vanilla Baba is You! 

In total, Zelbaba has:

- Ingame cutscenes
- 7 boss battles
- 4 custom composed music tracks
- 52 levels
- 11 Zelda items recreated
- Did I mention it makes an action-adventure out of a puzzle game?
- 3D implemented in a 2D game!

Plus, Baba is You creator Hempuli played it and loved it. [Watch his playthrough here!](https://youtube.com/watch?v=69CH0Zpvnd4)

## Whoa, how do I play it?
If you have the PC version of Baba is You, you can play Zelbaba just by dragging and dropping some files.
