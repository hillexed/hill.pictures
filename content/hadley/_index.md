# My First Telescope: the Hadley

{{< img src="PART_1693457620331_IMG_3090.jpg" alt="The Hadley telescope!">}}

This little 3D printed telescope kickstarted my journey into astronomy. The design is [free and open source](https://www.printables.com/model/224383-astronomical-telescope-hadley-an-easy-assembly-hig), and uses 3D printed parts, aluminum tubes, and hardware store nuts and bolts. 

It sits on the [Hill Mount](https://www.printables.com/model/565412-hill-mount-for-hadley-telescope), a portable and cheap altitude mount I designed that costs around $20. It's lightweight enough I have walked two miles carrying it the whole time taken it on the subway.

Azimuth is controlled by physically sliding the plastic across the ground. Sure, I could put it on a turntable, but that would make it heavier.
