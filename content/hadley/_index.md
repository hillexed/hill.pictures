This little 3D printed telescope kickstarted my journey into astronomy. The design is [free and open source](https://www.printables.com/model/224383-astronomical-telescope-hadley-an-easy-assembly-hig), and uses 3D printed parts, aluminum tubes, and hardware store nuts and bolts. 

It sits on the [Hill Mount](https://www.printables.com/model/565412-hill-mount-for-hadley-telescope), a portable and cheap altitude mount I designed that costs around $20. It's lightweight enough I have walked two miles to a subway stop carrying it the whole time.

Azimuth is controlled by physically sliding the plastic across the ground. Sure, I could put it on a turntable, but that would make it heavier.

It has a number of upgrades - including an integrated finderscope and a high-tech computerized aiming system I printed and hand-soldered myself. For more, see [Aiming](./aiming)

## Taking photos on a budget

I like to think of myself as on the cutting edge of cell phone astrophotography. I use a 3D printed clamp to hold my phone up to the eyepiece and take photos using my phone camera. However, tapping the phone button causes vibrations that wobble the telsecope. To fix that, I use a raspberry pi pico microcontroller as a wireless remote shutter. I programmed it to act as a bluetooth mouse and connect to my phone. When I press the built-in button, it moves the mouse to the center of the screen and clicks the "take picture" button. To see pictures this setup has taken, take a look at my [Astrophotos](/astrophotos) page!
