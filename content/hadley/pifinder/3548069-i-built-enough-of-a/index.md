I built enough of a pifinder to test it! This pifinder is using a pi camera v1 because I salvaged an old secondhand pi project... and it was able to see one or two stars, but not much more because of light pollution. Not enough to see the stars and plate solve to see where in the sky it was aimed at. I ordered a better $33 camera, maybe that'll work
