I'm building the Sliced PiFinder, a device to help my telescope find things! [Previously, I tried using a cheaper IMU but gave up and bought a $30 fancy chip.](https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/3741817-pifinder-perils)

Originally I didn't want to buy a $50 GPS USB stick but the PiFinder creator found a $10 solderable GPS unit for a v2, so I bought one and soldered it in.

After soldering in the GPS chip, dubiously electrical taping it in place, dropping it and cracking my 3D printed parts, printing new parts, using a soldering iron to remove heat inserts out of the old parts so I can place them into the new parts, printing the case, discovering the case wasn't designed for my battery and blocks access to the on/off switch and USB ports, melting holes in case with soldering iron, putting on a cover plate over the screen and LEDs... I finally put it on my telescope!

Testing on the telescope went well. The printed dovetail mount was slightly too thin and sagged slightly under gravity, but the field of view was wide enough it wasn't a problem. And even when I couldn't see any stars through my finderscope, the pifinder's camera still got a lock.

Eventually I tried using the find-objects feature, and it successfully pointed me towards M31! I tried pifinding to M33, but I didn't see it by eye. Maybe the streetlight 30 feet away was just too bright? Perhaps it'll show up on a long exposure phone cam.

Total cost, including the pi and battery pack I scavenged for free: $118. Much better than $550!
