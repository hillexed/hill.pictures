But it's slightly bigger than my previous camera, so I had to design a new part to hold it. While the pifinder was designed with M2.5 screws, this camera only accepts smaller M2 screws. I had to go to the hardware store yet again."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"The pifinder is designed for a raspberry pi HQ camera ($50). Originally instead I wanted to use a pi camera module V1 ($10, from 2013) because I recycled it from another project, but it didn't work too well. I designed a custom printed mount for that. This innomaker IMX462 camera is $33 and has a big pixel size, which means it's more sensitive to light (good for astronomy!). This means I'm on round 2 of designing custom holders for cameras the pifinder wasn't designed for!"}}],"pinned":false,"commentsLocked":false,"sharesLocked":false,"singlePostPageUrl":"https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/3638072-maybe-this-camera-wi"}
