I looked at mars with my 4.5" telescope. Previously it just looked like a big circle, but adding a 2x barlow lens to get to 150x zoom made it big enough I could make out a tiny line of slightly darker area on Mars! That's the first time that I saw any detail on mars! That's neat, but also wow my standards are so low.
