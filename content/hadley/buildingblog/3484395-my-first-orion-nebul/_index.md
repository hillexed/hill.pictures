The first picture is at 36x zoom, the second one at 150x zoom. The more zoomed in one is fainter because the same light is spread across more area, but you can see the four trapezium stars as four separate streaks!

This was a very frustrating night for photography because finding things in a big sky is hard. Light pollution made it hard to see M31, I couldn't find M33, and then finally clouds rolled in and it became a race against time to photograph the Orion nebula M42. I really need a motorized mount or other device to help me find things.
