Tried to take photos of the ring nebula but missed; planet conjunction was extremely slightly out of focus and I didn't see until morning, and I looked for but still couldn't see M33. Couldn't see any detail on mars by eye either; that should change as we get closer to opposition. I think I need to finish my bigger telescope."}}],"pinned":false,"commentsLocked":false,"sharesLocked":false,"singlePostPageUrl":"https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/7279657-the-planets-there"}
