Taken using my 4.5" telescope and phone! Both Mars and Jupiter fit into telescope view!

Very annoying observing session. Tried to take photos of the ring nebula but missed; planet conjunction was extremely slightly out of focus and I didn't see until morning, and I looked for but still couldn't see M33. Couldn't see any detail on mars by eye either; that should change as we get closer to opposition. I think I need to finish my bigger telescope.
