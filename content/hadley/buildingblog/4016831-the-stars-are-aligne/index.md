BEHOLD, MY FIRST STACKED ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY IMAGE!

This combines 20 1/2sec exposures taken with my phone through my 3D printed 4.5" telescope. You can see stars down to magnitude 12!! This is so cool.

Turns out I didn't see a galaxy in my photos because... I was looking at photos of a non-galaxy. This is the ring nebula, M57. Oops.
