Update: I've learned about the existence of EMT conduit, which is steel so it's much stiffer, cuttable with a handsaw, and most importantly way cheaper than the aluminum tubes I bought before! 

The downside is it's sized in nominal diameter, which means lying. The size "1/2 in" has an outer diameter of 0.706 in. But I've <a href="https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/1491006-one-imposter-remains">faced nominal diameter before</a> and this time I'm prepared. Let's try this.
