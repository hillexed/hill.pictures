I heard there was a meteor shower tomorrow! So naturally I went out today to see it. First I treated it like any other target and tried to find a good gap in the trees to see Perseus, but then I read online that meteors appear in the full sky, not just at the radiant.

So I lay down on the sidewalk, and 30 minutes later... zoop!

The meteor was super underwhelming compared to the time I spent waiting. A blink-and-you'll miss it streak of a little bit of light. I wish they had a sound like in fiction.
