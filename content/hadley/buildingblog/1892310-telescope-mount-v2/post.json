This new mount stood up well, but if I placed the telescope on the mount and gave it a sideways nudge, the telescope would wiggle from side to side at a period of about 1/4 s. It does seem less wobbly than my previous square mount, but it's still pretty wobbly."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"On the plus side, I added little degree markers so you could see what elevation your telescope is pointed at. I like them."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"I'm stuck as to where to go from here. How do I change this design to make it more rigid? I'm out of ideas. Maybe the wooden dowels are too flexible and I need to buy aluminum rods? But I can't cut aluminum to the right size. Damping exists as a theoretical idea, but how do I add some in practice?"}}],"pinned":false,"commentsLocked":false,"sharesLocked":false,"singlePostPageUrl":"https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/1892310-telescope-mount-v2"}
