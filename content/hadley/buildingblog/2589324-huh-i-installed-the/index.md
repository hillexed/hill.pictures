Huh. I installed the front truss addon, I'm observing now and finally noticed the direction of the wobble. After a transient big vibration period of 3s or so it settles down... and stars look like two points right next to each other instead of a big glob of light. Progress! I looked at a low-altitude object... And the direction of the two stars was up and down. I think I've finally defeated side to side wobble only to find my true opponent was altitude wobble
