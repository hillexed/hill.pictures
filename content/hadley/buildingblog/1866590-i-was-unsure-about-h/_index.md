I was unsure about how to model this part to make it non-wobbly so I looked up and watched a full lecture from MIT OCW about vibration reduction. it didn't really help but now I understand that when you bend a stick, the outer part expands and the inner part shrinks and so by making bigger areas farther from the bending (weird) you can resist shrinking and growing a bit more. how do I apply that to a complicated multi-beam twisting telescope part? unsure
