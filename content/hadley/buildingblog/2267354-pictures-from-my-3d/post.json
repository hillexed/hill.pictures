I got the clearest phone-cam Saturn I've ever seen! Wobbles still exist if you touch the telescope, but the wobbles are much smaller now and go away if I wait a few seconds or use a short exposure time. "}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"<details style=\"display:inline-block\"><summary>Before the wobbles settle down, if you take a picture with a big exposure time, the wobbles cause the image to have two Saturns.</summary><img src=\"https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/a5ee15fe-4a31-456b-bb58-9313b552230b/image.png\"></img></details> I think that confirms my theory that the long stretched out Saturn I saw with Mount V2 was caused by a tiny wobble. Overall, it's not wobble-free and could use some damping, but I declare Mount v3 a success!"}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"I also got Jupiter again, and I could see two Galilean moons by eye but I couldn't capture any using camera. I couldn't see any of the stripes, though. Jupiter is way more featureless than I expected; I wonder if there are any cheap filters I can use to see more of the stripes."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"In the last picture, I took a very long 4s exposure of Saturn. The earth's rotation meant, Saturn blurred into a streak, but take a close look - there's a smaller streak right next to it following Saturn! I think that's one of its moons, possibly Titan! It's so cool that I can see it from my backyard."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"Things to improve:\n- Make the mount even stiffer?\n- How do I add damping, to make vibrations decay over time?\n- Just as I was writing this, I discovered some smudges on my eyepiece. Oops! Maybe that's adding some glare. Hopefully once I clean that I can get even sharper images!\n- Try image stacking?\n"}}],"pinned":false,"commentsLocked":false,"sharesLocked":false,"singlePostPageUrl":"https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/2267354-pictures-from-my-3d"}
