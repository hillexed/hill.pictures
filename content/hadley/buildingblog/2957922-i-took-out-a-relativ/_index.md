I took out a relative's 8x42 binoculars today. Saw M7 as a faint sparkling of stars, but Andromeda was a much dimmer smudge compared to my telescope that if I hadn't seen it before I wouldn't have been able to spot. It I was able to follow a satellite though! And I got to show off Mizar and Alcor to others!

Sadly the moon was out and it was so bright it was casting shadows, stopping me from seeing any nebulae like I was hoping. Grr, how dare the moon be out there.
