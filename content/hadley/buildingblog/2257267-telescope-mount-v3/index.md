This mount is my stiffest one yet!

Changes from last time:

- uses steel EMT instead of wooden dowels, for extra stiffness
- flat sides so you can see the degree markings
- deeper and more visible degree markings

It feels pretty darn stiff! Unfortunately, tapping the side still makes the telescope wobble. It's definitely much less wobble than before, though. Maybe it'll be enough for clear pictures!
