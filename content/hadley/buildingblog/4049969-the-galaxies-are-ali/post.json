You're looking at 20 phone pics taken through my 3D printed telescope, each 1/2s exposure so the Earth didn't rotate as much during the photo and smear the stars. I tried the program deepskystacker, but it failed to stack my pictures (maybe my phone camera's pics had too much noise?) so over 3 days I wrote some custom python code using astropy and astroalign to stack them myself!"}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"Look at all those dim stars! That's so many stars! In the bottom right that slightly fuzzy star is actually the core of M31's satellite galaxy M110! I was hoping to see some dust lines or spiral arms, but I guess I'll need more data for that.
