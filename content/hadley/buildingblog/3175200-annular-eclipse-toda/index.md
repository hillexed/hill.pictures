Reminder to North and South Americans, there's an eclipse today! https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/in/usa?iso=20231014
DON'T LOOK AT THE SUN WITHOUT SPECIAL ECLIPSE GLASSES, EVEN DURING A PARTIAL ECLIPSE! If you don't have one, take a piece of paper, punch a hole in it, and look at the shadow. Trees or colanders with many holes will make very cool shadows!
