(Part 2 of my adventures with my <a href="https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/1502022-diy-telescope-compl">3D printed telescope!</a>)

I printed a collimation helper and a basket! The collimation helper helped me find out that I thought I was collimated, but was actually misaligned. With proper collimation, I went out again and took this new picture of Venus. 

To the eye, collimation didn't seem like it did anything, because my telescope and its mount was just so wobbly it looked the same to the eye as before. But my phone pic definitely seems better - now you can see the waxing gibbous shape instead of bright dot. Don't know why.

I also found out "open ocular" is a 3D printable mount to hook a phone up to a telescope. I'm making one now. Hopefully that'll help make it less wobbly?
