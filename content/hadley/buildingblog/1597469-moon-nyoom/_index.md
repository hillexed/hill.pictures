With all <a href="https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/1567101-telescope-upgrade-2">those upgrades</a>, I was able to mount my phone to <a href="https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/1502022-diy-telescope-compl">my telescope</a>. Recently, the moon finally reached the right phase for it to be visible, so I got great shots of the moon!

With my 6mm high power lens, the moon was super duper detailed. And I realized something amazing: the moon was moving. I was so zoomed in I could see the rotation of the earth! That's incredible! 

Now that my phone is mounted, I don't have to manually hold it up to take a picture, meaning video became possible. To my amazement, 3 minutes was enough for the moon to enter and exit the telescope's view. I took a video and made a timelapse:

 It's one thing to know the earth is rotating. It's another thing to see it with your own eyes. The universe is so cool.
