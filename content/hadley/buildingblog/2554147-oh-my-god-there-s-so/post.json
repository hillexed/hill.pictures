You could barely make out an arc slightly lighter in the sky than the rest of it! The Milky Way! Through a telescope, there were much more stars than before and they just kept going and going if you moved the telescope. Saw the plediades too wow many bright stars near each other"}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"No photos of nebulae, my goal, because my openocular malfunctioned and didn't hold the phone to the camera well. No eye sightings of nebulae like m57 either because oh god the sky is so big and aiming is so hard and you look into the telescope and it's full of stars and you're lost"}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"This photo is a 30 second timelapse at ISO 3200, the strongest it can go, from my phone camera placed on a concrete block. Edited to increase contrast and saturation. THAT'S A GALAXY"}}],"pinned":false,"commentsLocked":false,"sharesLocked":false,"singlePostPageUrl":"https://cohost.org/hillexed/post/2554147-oh-my-god-there-s-so"}
