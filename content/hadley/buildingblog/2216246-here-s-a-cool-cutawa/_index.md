Here's a cutaway view of my telescope's 3D printed bases to hold rods in place. The rods go into the giant cylinders, but how do you stop them from slipping out? Insert a nut in on one side of the hole, and then screw it in from the other side. The cut in the top means the entire piece bends to hold the rod in tightly! This is so annoying to design because my rods are so close together you need to make sure that the cutaway for the nuts and screws don't accidentally cut a hole in the wall of the places where the rods go.

Hope it works.
