I put everything together for version 1 of my telescope truss mount. It stands! It was also an inch too wide for the telescope to properly rest on it. I had to rotate it the wrong way so it could fit on the stand for the picture. Aargh.

Some of the clamps did grip the rods well, some of the clamps didn't. The base did feel pretty solid, but the top part is still pretty wobbly after full assembly. I've learned a few lessons:

1. Longer holes for more grab surface area
2. Add some holes to screw my mount into the floor, which will stop flexing in addition to being a requested feature
3. Right now I have 0.5in rods, and they're fitting in 0.52in holes. If my mount is wobbly, maybe I should decrease the hole tolerance to 0.51in? It's a tradeoff but may be worth it
4. Redesign rear base back grabber, it doesn't grab properly
5. It's 6.5 inches wide from outside to outside, not 7.5 inches. :(

Now, to design version 2!
