 Since Orion was so high in the sky compared to my last photo I was curious if photos would look better... and they do!

This is one 1/2s phone pic, scaled to hell and back to bring out the "bat wings": big dark edges that go from bottom left to top right. Now I know there's many ways to make this better, such as motorizing or a bigger telescope or stacking multiple pictures - but for just one phone pic this isn't that bad!
