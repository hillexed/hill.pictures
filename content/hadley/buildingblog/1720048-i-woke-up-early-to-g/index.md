I woke up early to go see Jupiter and Saturn and turns out it's still really really hard to align this telescope! I took videos in the hopes I'd catch at least one good frame, now to review them and see if that's true. I got a decent video of Saturn in my low power lens, hope it shows up well as rings instead of fuzzy blob
