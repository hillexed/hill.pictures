That's a second of arc, 1/60 of a minute of arc, which is 1/60 of a degree. That means it wobbles 2 saturns * 18.96 arcseconds/saturn * 1/60 * 1/60 * 2π/360 radians/arcsecond = .0001838 radians. My telescope is about 1.75 feet long from the center point, so since sin θ = o/h, the tip of the telescope is moving side-to-side a distance of h * sin θ ≈ 1.5ft * .00009192 = 0.08403 mm in that picture. Wow, that's about one printed layer line.</details>"}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"How do I stop that?"}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"Right now my telescope mount looks like this.
