I've been thinking about https://www.space.com/liquid-telescope-construction-in-space-ax-1 . I wonder if you could take a circular baking tray, spin it on a pottery wheel, and then pour SLA 3D printing resin into it so the resin would form a liquid mirror, then shine UV light on it to cure it and make a telescope mirror
