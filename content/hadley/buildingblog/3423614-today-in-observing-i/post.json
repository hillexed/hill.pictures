Realized my finderscope was misaligned, couldn't get it aligned in time before it sank below a tree.\n- Tried to get a photo of Jupiter, succeeded! Tried out a new phone app named skeyecam that lets you take many many photos with the same settings, for some reason it made Jupiter green. \n- Then I tried taking a photo of m42 through the 6mm lens, but I couldn't get anything on camera. Then I messed with my setup to see if it was aligned, only saw a star and not a nebula, tried to take off, then dropped and broke my openocular, and only after all that discovered I was aiming at the wrong group of 3 stars in Orion and was actually aiming at alnilan instead.
