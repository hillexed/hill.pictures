title: 'The 12" Meniscus Mirror'

My third telescope project pushes the boundaries of telescope technology, using kiln draping techniques to create a thin yet constant thickness lightweight mirror that will give bright views for cheap.

I bought the glass that became this mirror for $20 from an used furniture store in the form of a glass countertop.
