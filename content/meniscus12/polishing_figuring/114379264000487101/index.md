More wide parabolizing strokes are bringing my 12" mirror closer and closer to a sphere...

I have a slight worn down edge, overall a tiny bit oblate, as well as a tiny central hill, but it's all very small.

Here's a Ronchi test picture of the mirror today compared to two weeks ago. As a reminder, straight up and down is spherical.
