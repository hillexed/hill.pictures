My pitch lap polishing tool wasn't making good contact with the center of my mirror. I can tell because I'm just beginning polishing and so I can see that the mirror's outside is more reflective than the inside. Also, the tool looks unevenly worn. 

I tried heating up the tool using a tub of hot water so the pitch would flow and then pressing the tool against the mirror some more (pictured) but it seems to have only helped slightly. In the end I placed both pitch lap and mirror in a tub of hot water and pressed while underwater - and that heat seems to have finally let the pitch flow and fully copy the mirror shape across the entire surface.
