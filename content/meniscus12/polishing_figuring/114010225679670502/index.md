Another hour and a half of polishing and my piece of glass is looking much more reflective!

I was stroking with tool on top, but I noticed the center of the pitch lap wasn't making good contact. I suspect the plaster backing tool that the mirror rests on isn't evenly supporting the mirror; it picked up a slightly wavy surface I was hoping wouldn't cause issues. When I poured the tool I used wax paper to ensure it wouldn't stick to the mirror, and the wax paper crumpled slightly from being flat on a non-flat mirror surface. I think I will need to pour epoxy on top of the existing epoxy to get a nice smooth backing surface.

Total polishing time: 3 hours
