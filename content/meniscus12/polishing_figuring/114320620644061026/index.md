Polishing continues. I've noticed that my short center over center strokes seem to be creating a hill in the center of this mirror, so I've switched to longer 1/2-diameter strokes and 1/3 side to side motion in order to wear down the center of the mirror. It seems to be working, according to these ronchi test images before and after. I'm jumping the gun a little by figuring while polishing but there's a long way to go so I should be fine.
