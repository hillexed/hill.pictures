I finally started polishing this 12" mirror! It has taken so long and many failures to get here. I took the pitch lap tool that I made and carved some bonus channels into it, squirted on cerium oxide mixed with water, and got polishing. An hour and a half later, the outside of my mirror is polished and now is smooth enough to reflect light! It looks like my pitch lap wasn't pressed for long rnough to make good contact with the mirror, though, because I can see that only a ring around the outside is being worn down, not the center.
