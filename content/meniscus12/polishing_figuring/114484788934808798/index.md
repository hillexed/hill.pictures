Five or so 30 minute long sessions of long parabolizing W strokes have finally turned my center hill into a center hole. The dip at around 80% to 90% diameter remains, while the 90% to 100% diameter edge zone is turned up.

I made two changes to get better pitch contact: I am filling a plastic container with hot water and pressing the pitch to the glass underwater, and I am only polishing for 30 minutes at a time instead of going for a full hour. I think it's working!

Hopefully now that it's no longer an oblate spheroid, the standard 1/3 strokes will work properly and allow me to fix that bumpy outer zone and its turned up edge.
