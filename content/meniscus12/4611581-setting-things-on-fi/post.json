What's the difference between wood and furnace cement? Cement is heat resistant, and wood is very flammable. "}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"So I started a fire. I grabbed some sticks and some newspaper as kindling and piled it on, then lit it on fire inside a barbecue. Turns out I suck at starting a fire - I didn't have enough small sticks to sustain a fire for a while and catch the large wooden mold on fire. It burned decently, but didn't get hot enough to catch the wooden mold on fire."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"After all that... I ended up with lots of ash and some blackened wood that STILL wasn't separated from the furnace cement."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"Also, the cement itself, which was supposed to resist the heat, didn't resist the heat! It sprouted a giant pocket in the middle like naan. I thought I got rid of the moisture by drying for weeks... what happened?"}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"Turns out... I was using the wrong type of furnace cement all along. I need \"castable\" furnace cement - otherwise it won't let the water out. I was using \"furnace cement\" designed to seal over cracks, and in the fine print it said \"spread a thin layer\".  Thin meant \"less than 1/4\" I suppose. Water and air couldn't get out of my 3/4\" blockt, and when I set it on fire it expanded and caused those bubbles."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"So I need to buy some castable furnace cement. I did some searching and it's only available in 50lb boxes for $70.
