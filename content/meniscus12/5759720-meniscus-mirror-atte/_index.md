I carved a new wood mold and used the last of my furnace cement on attempt #4... and because I was working with 1/3 a bucket of cement, I ended up with something very thin that cracked when I tried to lift it off the wood mold. Sigh

I only waited one day before trying to remove it, and I patted it dry with a paper towel. I think both of these were mistakes - the longer it sits wet, the harder it gets as crystals grow.

In this picture, attempt #4 is on the right, with the crack on the left. On top is attempt #1, which I set on fire. Attempt #2 on the left, with the wrong kind of cement. At least I'm improving...
