One of my telescope shenanigans is trying to make a meniscus mirror by slumping glass in a kiln. To do that, I need to make a precisely shaped form that can withstand kiln temperatures. I CNCed a wood mold, and next I need to put some furnace cement into that wooden mold so it becomes the right cement shape. I've never used furnace cement before. Wish me luck
