To give a circle of glass (approximately) the right curve for a telescope mirro,, I want to make a precisely shaped mold that can withstand kiln temperatures. This technique makes what's called a meniscus mirror.

Last time I tried this, the wood delaminated and came apart at the boundary where one plank was glued to another. This time, I'm spraying the wood with polyurethane spray on both the front AND back side, to avoid any warping before I put the furnace cement in. It seems to have warped a tiny bit, but only a fraction of an inch off the ground at one end. Hopefully it'll be OK.

Printed a new trowel (I love that I can say that), sanded the wood, wiped off dust with alcohol soaked paper towel, bought a different type of furnace cement, and spread furnace cement. Hopefully this will give me a nice curved furnace cement mold!
