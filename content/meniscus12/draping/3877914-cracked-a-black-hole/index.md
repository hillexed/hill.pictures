Poured some cement into my CNCed mold! Very fitting that my experimental telescope making technique involves a black hole

I noticed my mold had warped before putting cement on it - maybe from the polyurethane spray I used, or from waiting a month in between cncing and pouring? I put some weights on it because of the warping, walked away... And the next day I found my wood split down the middle of a boundary between planks. Oh well
