15 minutes of more grinding created even more scratches, starting from the edge and moving in. I think maybe I wasn't using enough liquid and my tool was knocking off bits of the edge glass and dragging them inwards.

To avoid any possibility of my tool having coarse grit caught in the channels in between tiles, I remade my tool. I bought some "tabletop epoxy" which takes 3 days to cure and covered my existing tool with it, then put on a new layer of tiles. I kept the tiles on the webbing this time, and it looks like that has created even, easily cleanable gaps in between each tile.
