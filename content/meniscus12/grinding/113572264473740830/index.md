Another hour of 5 micron grinding and, unlike the first time, no scratches! 

But then I looked closer. By using my phone flashlight, I saw one very thin and not very deep scratch (a "sleek"). That's fine. I also saw some thicker scratches around 1-2mm long intersecting the edge - see the photo. 

Maybe those marks are from bits of glass that were torn from the beveled edge? This adds credence to my theory that my previous scratch problems were bevel problems, not a speck of coarse grit contaminating.

That said, a tiny sleek and a few tiny scratches at the edge? That's only a tiny bit of light collecting area lost. I'll happily move on to polishing if I can instead of spending more effort getting these out.
