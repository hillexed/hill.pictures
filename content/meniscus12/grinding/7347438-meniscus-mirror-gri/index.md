I got a table for $5 at a yard sale. It looks perfect for a mirror grinding setup after putting some weights on the bottom rack.

Now that I've completed my 8" mirror polishing, it's time to try my bigger telescope mirror project. Just making this blank took a lot of effort - now, to grind it.

Let the grinding start!
