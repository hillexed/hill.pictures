Looks like after 3 hours of grinding at #220 grit, the divot that has been in my glass since the start has been ground out! Yay! I'm glad I went back to coarser grit; this could have easily been six hours had I stuck with #320.

A mirror with a short focal length will make objects look brighter because they're zoomed out, but is much harder to parabolize at the very end of the mirror making process. I was hoping my grinding would increase the focal length from 36" back to around 40". I measured and it's... 37.5", around f/3.1. Oh well.
