Grinding the back has gone smoothly. At first I didn't get good contact between tool and mirror; one orientation would slide freely but after turning the mirror 90 degrees any attempts to slide would lock up. Eventually the tool wore down and I got good contact. 

In these pictures, my goal is to spread the frosted area (where the mirror has been sanded down to a sphere) everywhere. Any smooth areas are where the grit hasn't made good contact (lower areas). You can really see that one axis was flatter than the others. Now the back is basically spherical, aside from one small region!
