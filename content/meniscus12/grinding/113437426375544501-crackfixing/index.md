I'm slowly dealing with [the crack](https://hill.pictures/meniscus12/113377434240142332/)'s aftermath. Slowly, I ground through the big hole I made when burnishing the crack. As I ground it down over the week, the crack wasn't visible under the loupe unless I put a flashlight sideways and used a finger to cover the top of the mirror, illuminating  from the side. After watching the hole get smaller and smaller, I took a look... and the crack was still barely visible. It's there in the last image as a slight diagonal line below the dot.

After the last picture, I ground for another hour and I can't find the crack anymore. I hope that means it's gone and I can move from size 320 silicon carbide grit to 30 micron aluminum oxide grit!

Total time spent grinding out the crack: 7.4 hours
