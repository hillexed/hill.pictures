Tragedy!

I dropped my tool onto the glass from an inch up. I thought I was fine, but close inspection revealed a crack a millimeter long. I was advised to try to burnish it out because the crack could travel very deep and spread.

I ended up putting a screw in a drill and using the head as a bootleg buffing wheel with my 30 micron water mix to try to dig out the crack and its subsurface damage. Now I have an ugly 4 square mm divot on my mirror, which is otherwise polished down to 30 micron abrasives. Sigh...
