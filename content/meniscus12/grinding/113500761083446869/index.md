Another tragedy! As I move to 12 and then 5 micron aluminum oxide grits, the final stages of fine grinding, scratches are showing up. I keep losing tiles from my tile tool, too. A scratch means some particle bigger than the current abrasive size is being introduced - maybe grit from earlier stages of grinding was trapped in between narrow gaps gaps in my tool's tiles? I probably have to go back to a coarser grit to get it out. Sighhhh
