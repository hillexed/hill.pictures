My refurbished tool is ready to go. However, I have to go back a few sizes to coarser grit to ensure the tool is ground down evenly to make good contact across its full area. From 5 micron (the last size of grit needed) back to 30 micron size grit I go...

Thankfully, after an hour of grinding, it looks like it's wearing evenly. It's sliding smoothly across the mirror. All tiles started out with some texture from the webbing they were originally attached to, so in the picture a smooth tile is a sign that the tile has been worn away (and making good contact). Some tiles still have the texture, so they must be lower. The worn tiles seem randomly distributed instead of clustered on one side of the tool, which is good.

For the most part in between the tiles is a 1 mm wide gap with a smooth floor from the hardened resin. Some tiles have crud filling the gap; it looks like the resin climbed up the gap between tiles through capillary action and hardened. Annoying. I spent a while with a knife removing some of that but there's too much; I hope it doesn't trap grit particles and cause scratches later.
