I got the news from my local glass studio in an all-caps email that said nothing but "IT WORKED!"

Look at this! My glass is now clearly curved, around 1/4" taller at the sides than at the center! That's very close to f/4, my goal! <s>SLUMPING</s> CRADLING: SUCCESS

Weirdly, even though the mirror is the right shape, the cement form seems to have warped. The top face is now flat, and the bottom is now curved - which is weird because originally the bottom was flat and the top was curved. The bottom side looks... cracked? Like the bottom expanded? Maybe the water I sprinkled on top to prolong crystal formation ended up causing something weird.

The mirror is pretty smooth except for two pits, each 1/4mm deep. I circled them in black. Not bad at all!

Next steps: grind it smooth to within nanometers!
