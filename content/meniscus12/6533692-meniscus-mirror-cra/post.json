The top face is now flat, and the bottom is now curved - which is weird because originally the bottom was flat and the top was curved. The bottom side looks... cracked? Like the bottom expanded? Maybe the water I sprinkled on top to prolong crystal formation ended up causing something weird."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"The mirror is pretty smooth except for two pits, each 1/4mm deep.
