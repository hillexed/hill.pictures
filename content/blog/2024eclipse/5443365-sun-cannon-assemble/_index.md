Introducing "Finley", probably the jankiest and most colorful eclipse imaging setup of all time. The only telescope I have which is enclosed (and therefore safe to use on the sun) is this donated finderscope, meaning I'll have crosshairs in all my images. I'm taking pictures using my friend's phone which he gave to me after the screen cracked. I designed a 3D printed adapter so it fits on the sturdy 3D printed mount I designed for the far bigger Hadley telescope. The whole thing looks like it's made of legos. I hope it works and I get good eclipse pictures!
