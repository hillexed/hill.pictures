I saw the aurora! It looked like light pollution at first, and I only realized what it was when I noticed the underwhelming "clouds" were in a different place after ten seconds. An hour later they had slight tints of red and green and distinct ray-like shapes! Very cool. Phone camera picked up way more color and detail than I could see by eye, and long 8s exposures picked up even more.
