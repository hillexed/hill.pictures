(Zoom into these photos to see Mars!)

Taken using my [Hadley](/hadley) 3D printed telescope, with a crowd of friends invited to watch the occultation of mars by the moon! The phone I was taking photos on ran out of battery, so I hastily threw a friend's iphone into the holder just in time to capture these.
