This is the 1985 "electronotes builder's guide and preferred circuits collection" and Bernie Hutchins is advising first time synth makers go buy chemicals at radioshack to etch copper and use a paintbrush to trace out wires manually. It's so weirdly analog and hands-on compared to the way circuit boards are made today I'm used to, "pay someone else online to do it"
