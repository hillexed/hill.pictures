So I was talking to new local friends and telling them about telescopes and someone says "I have a mirror sitting on my table, is that something that could be useful?" and so after picking it up I now have a ginormous 12.25" mirror that's 2.25" thick!!

...now what do I do with it? Honestly I'm tempted to make a scope out of it... but that would take money and I'd need to learn new skills like woodworking. And I still need to finish figuring my 8", which already has an entire telescope built waiting for the mirror to be done, and I have the 12" meniscus mirror project. So I guess I'm leaning towards selling it?
